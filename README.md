## üï∑Ô∏è Scrapy URL Blocker Middleware

Block unwanted URLs in your Scrapy projects with intelligent filtering.

### Quick Setup

1. **Add to your Scrapy project's `settings.py`:**
```python
DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'ps_helper.url_blocker.URLBlockerMiddleware': 585,
}

# Configure words to block
URL_BLOCKER_WORDS = ['admin', 'login', '.css', '.js', 'api/']
URL_BLOCKER_MODE = 'partial'  # or 'strict'
```

2. **Run your spider** - unwanted URLs will be automatically filtered!

### Filtering Modes

#### Partial Mode (Default)
Blocks URLs containing the word as a substring:
```python
URL_BLOCKER_MODE = 'partial'
URL_BLOCKER_WORDS = ['auth']

# Results:
# ‚ùå BLOCKED: site.com/authentication (contains 'auth')
# ‚ùå BLOCKED: site.com/auth (contains 'auth')
```

#### Strict Mode
Blocks only exact word matches in URL components:
```python
URL_BLOCKER_MODE = 'strict'  
URL_BLOCKER_WORDS = ['auth']

# Results:
# ‚úÖ ALLOWED: site.com/authentication ('auth' ‚â† 'authentication')
# ‚ùå BLOCKED: site.com/auth ('auth' = 'auth')
```

### Configuration Options

```python
# Required
URL_BLOCKER_WORDS = ['admin', 'login', '.pdf', 'tracking']

# Optional (with defaults)
URL_BLOCKER_MODE = 'partial'           # 'partial' or 'strict'
URL_BLOCKER_CASE_SENSITIVE = False     # Case sensitivity  
URL_BLOCKER_LOG_BLOCKED = True         # Show blocked URLs in logs
